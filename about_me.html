        <h2>Upcoming Travel Plans</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I haven't taken very many fun trips recently, however I do have one coming up that I'm looking forward to quite a bit.
    After the spring semester ends I'm going to Europe for two weeks.
    I'm flying into Amsterdam, where I've been before, but from there I'm headed to Copenhagen and Berlin which will both be new experiences!<br />

        <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    </header>
    <a href="https://www.honeyrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Honey in Doylestown, PA</a>
    <p>Honey is a tapas style restaurant that re-invents and elevates classic American fare like crab cakes or corn on the cob. <br />
        It's small and family owned, which makes me even happier to support it. <br />

    I love fried chicken! It's a delicious, flavorful dish that's perfect for a warm summer evening. <br />
    You can make it in a variety of ways, including a bit healthier (by air frying) or more indulgent (by deep frying and serving with waffles and maple syrup)!
